# Development Notes

## Completed
- Created Discord bot that broadcasts all messages to `http://localhost:1010` and replies to `!req`.
- Added configuration file `config.ini` holding all settings.
- Provided Windows batch scripts for installation and launching.
- Wrote setup instructions in `README.md`.

## Partially Done
- No receiver service at `localhost:1010` implemented.
- No advanced command handling beyond `!req`.

## Next Steps
- Implement a local server to capture broadcasts.
- Extend bot with additional commands and logging.

## Completion
- Estimated completion: 60%
